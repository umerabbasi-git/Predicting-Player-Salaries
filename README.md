# BREAKING DOWN THE NUMBERS: HOW NBA PLAYER STATS IMPACT SALARIES

In this personal project, I conducted an in-depth analysis to identify the key NBA player statistics that have the most significant impact on players' salaries. Using R, I employed advanced data transformation techniques and rigorous model verification methods to arrive at conclusive findings. For further insights, please refer to the attached [.pdf file](R_Abbasi_U_NBA_Player_Salaries.pdf), which provides a detailed report on the project. Additionally, you can access the [.Rmd file](Abbasi_U_P3.Rmd) to explore the R code used for the analysis, gaining a deeper understanding of the methodology employed.
